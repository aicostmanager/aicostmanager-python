# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.26] - 2025-01-27
### Enhanced
- **Delivery Classes Simplified Initialization**: Major improvement to both `PersistentDelivery` and `ImmediateDelivery` constructors making them much easier to use with intelligent defaults
- **Configuration Management**: Enhanced INI file integration - both delivery classes now automatically read configuration overrides from `AICM.INI` including `AICM_API_BASE`, `AICM_DB_PATH`, timeouts, and logging settings
- **HTTP Client Error Handling**: Improved error handling in delivery base class to detect and handle closed HTTP clients gracefully, preventing unnecessary retry attempts
- **FastAPI Integration**: Streamlined FastAPI documentation focusing on modern lifespan context manager patterns with simplified tracker initialization

### Added
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Both `PersistentDelivery()` and `ImmediateDelivery()` can now be instantiated with zero parameters - automatically use `AICM_API_KEY` from environment and read configuration overrides from INI files
- **Consistent API**: Both delivery classes now have identical initialization patterns for easy switching between delivery types
- **Configuration Priority System**: Clear precedence order - environment variables (highest), INI file settings, hardcoded defaults (fallback)
- **One-line Setup**: Simplified from complex configuration to `DeliveryClass()` + `Tracker(delivery=delivery)` pattern for both delivery types

### Changed
- **Breaking**: FastAPI documentation now focuses only on lifespan context manager (removed deprecated startup/shutdown events since no one is using them yet)
- **Simplified Examples**: Updated all documentation examples to use new simplified initialization patterns
- **Better Error Messages**: HTTP client closure errors now provide clearer messages and don't attempt futile retries

### Fixed
- **Race Condition**: Resolved HTTP client closure issue that occurred when tracker was closed while async operations were still pending
- **Documentation Consistency**: Updated HeyGen, tracker, and persistent delivery documentation to use new simplified patterns

## [0.1.24] - 2025-01-27
### Enhanced
- **HeyGen Integration**: Comprehensive step-by-step documentation (`docs/heygen.md`) covering complete API integration workflow from session retrieval to cost tracking
- **HeyGen Testing**: Improved test coverage with separate session sets for immediate vs persistent delivery methods to prevent duplicate tracking
- **Deepgram Support**: Enhanced documentation and testing for websocket transcription and streaming text-to-speech services
- **Persistent Delivery**: Improved queue management leveraging automatic context manager flushing, reducing manual drainage wait logic while maintaining reliability

### Added
- Complete HeyGen API integration examples with both immediate and persistent delivery methods
- Production-ready HeyGen sync functions suitable for cron jobs and scheduled tasks
- Enhanced error handling and troubleshooting guidance for HeyGen API integration

### Fixed
- Simplified persistent queue drainage by better utilizing the automatic `stop()`/`close()` behavior in context managers
- Reduced unnecessary manual timeout logic while maintaining test reliability
- Updated import organization and code formatting consistency

## [0.1.23] - 2025-01-27
### Fixed
- `PersistentDelivery` logger initialization issue that caused `AttributeError: 'PersistentDelivery' object has no attribute 'logger'` when accessing the logger during database setup before parent class initialization
- Initialize logger early in `PersistentDelivery.__init__()` to ensure it's available for database operations and warning messages about failed queue items

### Added
- `track_llm_usage` and `track_llm_usage_async` methods for automatic usage
  extraction from LLM responses, with streaming helpers.
- `AICM_LIMITS_ENABLED` configuration to toggle triggered limit enforcement in
  delivery components.

### Added

- REST API tracking guide (`docs/rest.md`) and example script `examples/heygen_sync.py` showing batch/manual tracking with `Tracker`
- Per-call context support in REST wrappers via `set_client_customer_key()` and `set_context()`

### Enhanced
- `UniversalExtractor`: base_url autodetection, streaming `final_fields` support, UUID generation for missing `response_id`, and broader JSON serialization (httpx.URL/urllib `ParseResult`, Pydantic `model_dump`, objects with `dict`/`__dict__`)
- `RestCostManager` and `AsyncRestCostManager`: pre-request triggered limit checks, delivery batching controls (`delivery_mode`, `on_full`, batch size/interval), and context manager helpers
- Documentation refreshed with REST wrapper usage and FastAPI tracker lifecycle guidance
