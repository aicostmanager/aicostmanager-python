- FastAPI integration examples with proper lifecycle management for tracker instances
- Comprehensive test coverage for new tracker functionality and validation scenarios
- Queue overflow handling with three modes: `block`, `raise`, or `backpressure` (with discard metrics)

### Fixed
- **Triggered limits retrieval** now properly fetches from API when local cache is missing or corrupted
- Improved reliability of end-to-end usage limit enforcement tests
- Better event loop management in delivery worker threads for async operations
- Enhanced config manager robustness when INI files lack required encrypted payloads

### Technical Improvements
- Added `on_discard` callback support for monitoring dropped payloads in delivery queues

- Added quick reference commands for common release tasks

## [0.1.12] - 2025-01-05
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed empty package builds by correcting setuptools package discovery configuration
- Packages built with previous versions (0.1.10 and earlier) contained only metadata without actual Python source code
- This resolves issues where `uv add aicostmanager` and `pip install aicostmanager` resulted in empty package installations
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to properly include source files in wheel distributions

## [0.1.11] - 2025-08-04
### Fixed
- Fixed the version number in the __init__


## [0.1.10] - 2025-08-04
### Added
- Custom client metadata support with `client_customer_key` and `context` parameters
- New `set_client_customer_key()` and `set_context()` methods for all cost manager classes
- Automatic augmentation of usage payloads with client metadata for tracking and identification
- Client metadata support across all cost manager types: `CostManager`, `AsyncCostManager`, `RestCostManager`, and `AsyncRestCostManager`

### Enhanced
- Updated project dependencies to latest versions for improved compatibility and security
- Enhanced test coverage with comprehensive client metadata validation across all LLM providers
- Improved payload tracking with consistent metadata injection across sync and async operations

### Technical Improvements
- Unified `_augment_payload()` method implementation across all cost manager classes
- Comprehensive test suite covering client metadata functionality for OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible providers

## [0.1.9] - 2025-01-30
### Fixed
- Fixed triggered limits initialization reliability during `CostManagerClient` instantiation
- Resolved test execution order dependency in `test_usage_limit_end_to_end` that caused intermittent failures
- Fixed global delivery state interference between test suites by adding proper test isolation
- Prevented spurious "ini" file creation in project root directory during mock testing
- Enhanced environment variable cleanup in client configuration tests

### Enhanced
- Improved triggered limits lifecycle management with consistent ETag-based fetching logic
- Strengthened client initialization to always call `/configs` endpoint and conditionally fetch `/triggered-limits`
- Enhanced config manager alignment with client initialization for better state consistency
- Added robust test isolation with `clean_delivery` fixture to prevent cross-test pollution
- Improved mock test safety by preventing file system operations with literal "ini" paths

### Added
- `RestCostManager` class for tracking costs of generic REST API calls using `requests.Session`
- `AsyncRestCostManager` class for tracking costs of async REST API calls using `httpx.AsyncClient`
- Universal REST API cost tracking capabilities for non-LLM services and custom APIs
- Support for tracking HTTP method calls (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS) with automatic usage extraction

### Technical Improvements
- All 81 core tests now pass reliably regardless of execution order
- Usage limit enforcement works consistently across different test scenarios
- Better separation between mock and real client behavior in test environment
- Enhanced triggered limits state management in INI file persistence layer

## [0.1.8] - 2025-01-30
### Fixed
- Fixed syntax error in `test_async_client.py` where elif statement had incorrect indentation
- Fixed config manager test mock functions to properly accept `etag` parameter
- Added missing `configs_etag` attribute and property to `AsyncCostManagerClient` class
- Fixed real test failures in `test_anthropic_real_cost_manager.py` by adding triggered limits cleanup
