# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.38] - 2025-09-25
### Changed
- **API Request Format Updates**: Updated test suite to align with server-side API changes:
  - Removed `api_id` field from direct HTTP request bodies as the API no longer accepts this parameter
  - Updated error handling expectations to match current API behavior where invalid service keys return `service_key_unknown` status instead of errors
  - Modified payload validation expectations where invalid payloads are now queued (`status: 'queued'`) instead of rejected with errors
  - Updated test assertions to properly validate the new response formats for various error conditions

### Fixed
- **Test Compatibility**: Fixed failing `test_deliver_now_multiple_events_with_errors` test to work with the updated server API response formats and validation rules

## [0.1.37] - 2025-09-19
### Removed
- **User-Based Limit Logic**: Completely removed backward compatibility for user-specific limits. The following components no longer support user-based filtering:
  - `TriggeredLimit` class no longer has `user` field
  - `TriggeredLimitPayload` model no longer has `user` field
  - `TriggeredLimitsCache` no longer stores or retrieves user information
  - Removed user filtering logic from triggered limits processing
  - Removed `test_triggered_limit_user_filter` test function

### Enhanced
- **Simplified Triggered Limits**: Streamlined triggered limits functionality by removing user-based complexity:
  - Cleaner filtering logic that only considers service key and customer key matching
  - Reduced cache complexity with focus on core data storage
  - Simplified model definitions without legacy user fields
  - Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary user comparison operations

### Changed
- **API Compatibility**: Updated internal models to no longer expect or handle user fields in triggered limit responses, aligning with the current API specification that no longer supports user-based limits

## [0.1.36] - 2025-09-18
### Changed
- **API Parameter Rename**: Renamed `client_customer_key` to `customer_key` throughout the entire codebase for consistency and simplicity. This affects all models, methods, and documentation. The `set_client_customer_key()` method is now `set_customer_key()`.

## [0.1.35] - 2025-09-16
### Changed
- **Default Error Handling**: Changed `AICM_RAISE_ON_ERROR` default from `true` to `false`. By default, tracking failures now log errors and continue instead of raising exceptions. Set `AICM_RAISE_ON_ERROR=true` to restore the previous behavior.
- **API Model Updates**: Updated cost event models to align with latest API:
  - `CostEvent` renamed to `CostEventItem`
  - `vendor_id` field renamed to `provider_id`
  - `service_id` field renamed to `service_key`
  - Enhanced type flexibility for cost fields to support both numeric and string values
  - Updated `ErrorResponse` schema: `error`/`message` fields renamed to `detail`/`code` for API consistency
- **API Parameter Updates**: Renamed `api_id` parameter to `service_key` across all Tracker methods for consistency with the updated API
- **Environment Variable Cleanup**: Removed legacy `AICM_DELIVERY_LOG_BODIES` environment variable in favor of the standardized `AICM_LOG_BODIES`

### Added
- **Vendor-API Mapping**: Added `_get_vendor_api_mapping()` helper method to Tracker class for extracting vendor and API information from service keys
- **Service Key Building**: Added `_build_final_service_key()` method for constructing proper service keys from API responses
- **Parameter Resolution**: Added `_resolve_tracking_params()` helper for intelligent fallback handling of client metadata
- **Response Metadata Attachment**: Added `_attach_tracking_metadata()` method to safely attach tracking results to LLM response objects
- **Enhanced Type Support**: Improved cost field handling to support flexible numeric/string types in API responses
- **Code Organization**: Added comprehensive section comments and method organization within Tracker class
- **Expanded Model Library**: Added comprehensive new model classes for tracking, analytics, webhooks, and custom services:
  - `TrackRequest`, `TrackResponse`, `TrackResult`, `TrackedRecord` for tracking operations
  - `TriggeredLimitPayload` for encrypted limit data
  - Analytics models: `CustomerBreakdownSchema`, `TrendsResponseSchema`, `SnapshotsResponseSchema`
  - Webhook models: `WebhookEndpointCreate`, `WebhookEndpointOut`, `WebhookEndpointsResponse`
  - Custom service models: `CustomServiceIn`, `CustomServiceOut`, `CustomCostUnitIn`
  - Export scheduling models: `ExportScheduleCreate`, `ExportScheduleOut`, `ExportJobsResponse`

### Fixed

- **Factory Function**: Updated `create_delivery` factory to properly handle `log_bodies` parameter for immediate delivery, reading from kwargs, environment variables (`AICM_LOG_BODIES` or `AICM_DELIVERY_LOG_BODIES`), with fallback to `False`

### Enhanced
- **Parameter Compatibility**: `ImmediateDelivery` constructor now accepts `log_bodies: bool = False` parameter for consistency with `PersistentDelivery`
