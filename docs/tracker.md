# Manual Usage Tracking (`Tracker`)

Use the `Tracker` to record custom usage events that are not tied to a wrapped SDK call. This is useful for batch jobs, internal tools, custom metrics, or any workflow where you want full control over the `usage` payload.

## Overview

- Validates your payload against a configuration-provided `manual_usage_schema`
- Uses the same resilient delivery queue and retry logic as `CostManager`
- Supports client context via `client_customer_key` and `context`
- Async factory for non-blocking initialization in web apps
- `close()` method for graceful shutdown

## Basic Usage

```python
from aicostmanager import Tracker

tracker = Tracker(
    config_id="your-config-id",
    service_id="your-service-id",
)

tracker.track({
    "tokens": 256,
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
})
```

To bypass the queue and send immediately, use `deliver_now` which returns the
server response:

```python
resp = tracker.deliver_now("openai", "gpt-5-mini", {"tokens": 1})
assert resp.status_code == 200
```

## Validation and Errors

If your configuration includes a `manual_usage_schema`, values are validated with the built-in `TypeValidator`. When validation fails a `UsageValidationError` is raised summarizing issues:

```python
from aicostmanager import Tracker, UsageValidationError

try:
    tracker.track({"tokens": "oops"})
except UsageValidationError as exc:
    print(exc.errors, exc.missing_fields, exc.extra_fields)
```

Supported type strings include:

- Basic: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`
- Collections: `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`
- Optional and unions: `Optional[T]`, `Union[A, B, ...]`

## Client Context

```python
tracker.track(
    {"duration": 12.3},
    client_customer_key="acme_corp",
    context={"project": "chatbot_v2", "env": "prod"},
)
```

## Custom Response IDs and Timestamps

If the API you are tracking provides its own session or request identifier or
timestamp, you can supply them instead of letting the tracker generate new
values:

```python
session_id = remote_response["session_id"]
created_at = remote_response["created_at"]
tracker.track(
    {"duration": 12.3},
    response_id=session_id,
    timestamp=created_at,
)
```

## Async Initialization (Web Apps)

```python
from aicostmanager import Tracker

tracker = await Tracker.create_async("cfg", "svc")
# ... use tracker.track(...)
tracker.close()  # during shutdown
```

### FastAPI Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from aicostmanager import Tracker

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup() -> None:
    app.state.tracker = await Tracker.create_async("cfg", "svc")

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def shutdown() -> None:
    app.state.tracker.close()

@app.post("/track")
async def track_usage(payload: dict) -> dict:
    app.state.tracker.track(payload)
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

## Delivery Behavior & Metrics

The tracker uses the global delivery queue. You can configure behavior when the queue is full with `delivery_on_full` or the `AICM_DELIVERY_ON_FULL` environment variable (`block`, `raise`, `backpressure`). When using backpressure, dropped payloads are counted and optionally reported via an `on_discard` callback.

Inspect metrics:

```python
from aicostmanager import get_global_delivery_health
print(get_global_delivery_health())
```

## Configuration Requirements

`Tracker` needs a `config_id` and `service_id` that correspond to entries provisioned in your AICostManager configuration. If a `manual_usage_schema` is defined for the config, payloads must conform to it.

# Manual Usage Tracking with `Tracker`

`Tracker` lets you send usage records directly to AICostManager when you
cannot or do not want to wrap an API client with `CostManager`.
It loads a manual usage schema from the service configuration to validate
payloads before delivery.

## Creating a Tracker

```python
from aicostmanager import Tracker

tracker = Tracker("cfg", "svc")
```

* ``cfg`` – configuration identifier returned from ``/configs``
* ``svc`` – the service identifier your usage belongs to

The tracker automatically loads the manual usage schema for the given
configuration.  If the schema declares required fields or types they will be
validated when calling :meth:`track`.

### Asynchronous factory

Configuration loading uses blocking I/O.  In async applications use the
factory to perform the setup in a thread:

```python
tracker = await Tracker.create_async("cfg", "svc")
```

The returned instance is ready to use inside your async code.

## Recording Usage

```python
usage = {"tokens": 10, "model": "gpt"}
tracker.track(usage, client_customer_key="cust1", context={"task": "demo"})
```

``client_customer_key`` associates the record with one of your customers and
``context`` allows attaching arbitrary metadata.  The tracker builds the payload
and queues it for background delivery.

If the usage dictionary does not match the schema a
:class:`UsageValidationError` is raised detailing the missing or invalid fields.

## Stopping the delivery worker

The tracker shares the global delivery worker by default. To shut it down
cleanly, call ``close`` during application shutdown. ``close()`` flushes the
delivery queue and blocks until all pending records have been sent. There is no
public API to inspect the queue, so wrap tracking in a ``try``/``finally`` block
to guarantee cleanup:

```python
tracker = Tracker("cfg", "svc")
try:
    tracker.track({"tokens": 5})
finally:
    tracker.close()
```

## FastAPI example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from aicostmanager import Tracker

app = FastAPI()

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup() -> None:
    app.state.tracker = await Tracker.create_async("cfg", "svc")

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def shutdown() -> None:
    app.state.tracker.close()

@app.post("/track")
async def track_usage(payload: dict) -> dict:
    app.state.tracker.track(payload)
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

The tracker instance is created once at startup, re-used for incoming requests
and closed when the application exits.
